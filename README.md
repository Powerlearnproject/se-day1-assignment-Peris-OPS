Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
it systematically applies engineering principles, methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems. it involves software product design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance. its important because it enable creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life such as communication.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
development of programming languages
establishment of software engineering as a discipline
advent of structured programming

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
design- create high level and detailed design of software interface.
implementation-writing code and building software according to design specifications.
testing- conducting tests to ensure software meets quality standards.
deployment-releasing software to users.
maintenance-provide ongoing support.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct phases flowing  downwards like a waterfall while Agile methodology is iterative and incremental approach focused of flexibility , collaboration and responding to change.
a scenario where waterfall methodology can be applied is Construction of a house or a brigde, these projects have clearly defined requirements and sequential process where each phase must be completeed before the next one begins. 
agile methodology can be used for projects with high uncertainity or innovation. developing a new feature or an innovative software solution where the end product is not entirely clear.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
sofware developer- writing codes and implementing software solutions.
quality assurance engineer- ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans.
project manager- oversees planning, exxecution, deliverly of software application.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are comprehensive tools for writing, debigging and testing code. e.g Visual Studio.
VCS they are for tracking changes to source code and cordinating work among team members. e.g Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing requirements which leads  to project delays.
tight deadlines which can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
these challenges can be overcomed by creating enough time to develop a software and also using Agile methodology which is flexible to changes,.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing- testing individual components of modules of software.
integration testing-testing interactions between different components of subsystems.
system testing-testing the entire software system as a whole.
acceptance- testing the software against user requirements to make sure it meets user needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is like creating a special recipe for your robot. a prompt tells the robot exactly what information you need and how you want it presented.
prompts maximize relevance and accuracy. they guide AI to provide responses that are more relevant to users needs.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt "write a cover letter"
Improved "write a cover letter for a administrative virtual assistant position"
the improved prompt will provide the exact details you neeed for a virtual assistant position while the vague one will provide general cover letter details.
